TODO
====

A fresh installation fails because there is no 'welcome' page.  Instead, detect that no such page exists and suggest that the user either configure the application to use a different default page (not yet possible, this is also TODO) or else create the default page (and the user should be given a link that will do so, but this is also TODO since /pages/new does not receive a name).
